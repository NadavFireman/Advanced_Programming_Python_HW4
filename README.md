# Advanced Programming: Student Performance Analysis (HW4)

This repository contains the solution for Home Assignment 4 in the Advanced Programming course (Shenkar College, IE&M).

The assignment focuses on using Python and Pandas for in-depth data analysis and statistical querying on the provided student performance dataset.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Analysis Workflow:** Importing, exploring, and structuring data from a **CSV file (`StudentsPerformance.csv`)** into a Pandas DataFrame.
* **Complex Data Querying:** Implementing conditional filtering, grouping, and statistical aggregation to derive insights regarding student demographics (gender, race, parental education).
* **Statistical Insights:** Analyzing the correlation between various factors (e.g., test preparation, lunch type) and student performance across Math, Reading, and Writing scores.
* **Data Visualization (Conceptual):** Preparing data for graphical representation to clearly communicate findings.

## Repository Content

* **`Advanced_Programming_HW4.ipynb`**: Full Python solution notebook with code and analysis results.
* **`StudentsPerformance.csv`**: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
* **`docs/Assignment_Instructions_4.pdf`**: Original assignment instructions.
